You can use the Command-Line Interface (CLI) provided by Astro to develop, build, and preview your project from a terminal window.

Use the CLI by running one of the **commands** documented on this page, optionally followed by any **flags**. Flags customize the behavior of a command. For example, to start the development server on port `8080`, you would combine the `astro dev` command with the `--port` flag: `astro dev --port 8080`.

In most cases you will use the CLI via your package manager:

<PackageManagerTabs>
  <Fragment slot="npm">
  ```shell
  npx astro dev --port 8080
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="pnpm">
  ```shell
  pnpm astro dev --port 8080
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="yarn">
  ```shell
  yarn astro dev --port 8080
  ```
  </Fragment>
</PackageManagerTabs>

If you started your project using [the `create astro` wizard](/en/install/auto/#1-run-the-setup-wizard), you can also use the scripts in `package.json` for a shorter version of these commands. See the `README.md` in your project for details of which commands are available.

<PackageManagerTabs>
  <Fragment slot="npm">
  ```shell
  # run the dev server on port 8080 using the `start` script in `package.json`
  npm run start -- --port 8080
  ```
  (The extra `--` before the `--port` flag is necessary for `npm` to pass your flags to the `astro` command.)
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="pnpm">
  ```shell
  # run the dev server on port 8080 using the `start` script in `package.json`
  pnpm start --port 8080
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="yarn">
  ```shell
  # run the dev server on port 8080 using the `start` script in `package.json`
  yarn start --port 8080
  ```
  </Fragment>
</PackageManagerTabs>

## `astro dev`

Runs Astro's development server. This is a local HTTP server that doesn't bundle assets. It uses Hot Module Replacement (HMR) to update your browser as you save changes in your editor.

<h3>Flags</h3>

Use these flags to customize the behavior of the Astro dev server. For flags shared with other Astro commands, see [common flags](#common-flags) below.

#### `--port <number>`

Specifies which port to run on. Defaults to `3000`.

#### `--host [optional host address]`

Sets which network IP addresses the dev server should listen on (i.e. non-localhost IPs). This can be useful for testing your project on local devices like a mobile phone during development.

- `--host` â€” listen on all addresses, including LAN and public addresses
- `--host <custom-address>` â€” expose on a network IP address at `<custom-address>`

:::caution
Do not use the `--host` flag to expose the dev server in a production environment. The dev server is designed for local use while developing your site only.
:::

## `astro build`

Builds your site for deployment. By default, this will generate static files and place them in a `dist/` directory. If [SSR is enabled](/en/guides/server-side-rendering/), this will generate the necessary server files to serve your site.

<h3>Flags</h3>

Use these flags to customize your build. For flags shared with other Astro commands, see [common flags](#common-flags) below.

#### `--drafts`

Includes [Markdown draft pages](/en/guides/markdown-content/#markdown-drafts) in the build.

## `astro preview`

Starts a local server to serve your static `dist/` directory.

This command is useful for previewing your build locally, before deploying it. It is not designed to be run in production. For help with production hosting, check out our guide on [Deploying an Astro Website](/en/guides/deploy/).

Since Astro 1.5.0, `astro preview` also works for SSR builds if you use an adapter that supports it. Currently, only the [Node adapter](/en/guides/integrations-guide/node/) supports `astro preview`.

Can be combined with the [common flags](#common-flags) documented below.

## `astro check`

Runs diagnostics (such as type-checking within `.astro` files) against your project and reports errors to the console. If any errors are found the process will exit with a code of **1**.

This command is intended to be used in CI workflows.

:::note
This command only checks types within `.astro` files.

## `astro add`

Adds an integration to your configuration. Read more in [the integrations guide](/en/guides/integrations-guide/#automatic-integration-setup).

## `astro docs`

Launches the Astro Docs website directly from the terminal.

## `astro telemetry`

Sets telemetry configuration for the current CLI user. Telemetry is anonymous data that provides the Astro team insights into which Astro features are most often used.

Telemetry can be disabled with this CLI command:

```shell
astro telemetry disable
```

Telemetry can later be re-enabled with:

```shell
astro telemetry enable
```

The `clear` command resets the telemetry data:

```shell
astro telemetry clear
```

:::tip[Want to disable telemetry in CI environments?]
Make sure you add the `astro telemetry disable` command to your CI scripts.

## Common flags

### `--root <path>`

Specifies the path to the project root. If not specified, the current working directory is assumed to be the root.

The root is used for finding the Astro configuration file.

```shell
astro --root myRootFolder/myProjectFolder dev
```

### `--config <path>`

Specifies the path to the config file relative to the project root. Defaults to `astro.config.mjs`. Use this if you use a different name for your configuration file or have your config file in another folder.

```shell
astro --config config/astro.config.mjs dev
```

### `--site`

Configures the [`site`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#site) for your project. Passing this flag will override the `site` value in your `astro.config.mjs` file, if one exists.

### `--base`

<Since v="1.4.1" />

Configures the [`base`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#base) for your project. Passing this flag will override the `base` value in your `astro.config.mjs` file, if one exists.

### `--verbose`

Enables verbose logging, which is helpful when debugging an issue.

### `--silent`

Enables silent logging, which will run the server without any console output.

## Global flags

Use these flags to get information about the `astro` CLI.

### `--version`

Prints the Astro version number and exits.

### `--help`

Prints the help message and exits.
